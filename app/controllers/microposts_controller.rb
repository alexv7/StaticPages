# At this point, creating a new micropost works as expected, as seen in 
# Figure 11.15. There is one subtlety, though: on failed micropost submission,
# the Home page expects an @feed_items instance variable, so failed submissions
# currently break. The easiest solution is to suppress the feed entirely by
# assigning it an empty array, as shown in Listing 11.48. (Unfortunately,
# returning a paginated feed doesnâ€™t work in this case. Implement it and click
# on a pagination link to see why.)
