<%= form_for(current_user.active_relationships.find_by(followed_id: @user.id),
             html: { method: :delete }) do |f| %>
  <%= f.submit "Unfollow", class: "btn" %>
<% end %>

<!-- These two forms both use form_for to manipulate a Relationship model object; 
the main difference between the two is that Listing 12.21 builds a new
relationship, whereas Listing 12.22 finds the existing relationship. Naturally,
the former sends a POST request to the Relationships controller to create a
relationship, while the latter sends a DELETE request to destroy a relationship.
(We’ll write these actions in Section 12.2.4.) Finally, you’ll note that the
follow form doesn’t have any content other than the button, but it still needs
to send the followed_id to the controller. We accomplish this with the
hidden_field_tag method in Listing 12.21, which produces HTML of the form

<input id="followed_id" name="followed_id" type="hidden" value="3" />
As we saw in Section 10.2.4 (Listing 10.50), the hidden input tag puts the
relevant information on the page without displaying it in the browser. -->
