<!-- The status feed partial defers the rendering to the micropost partial
defined in Listing 11.21:

<%#= render @feed_items %>
Here Rails knows to call the micropost partial because each element of
@feed_items has class Micropost. This causes Rails to look for a partial with
the corresponding name in the views directory of the given resource:

app/views/microposts/_micropost.html.erb
We can add the feed to the Home page by rendering the feed partial as usual
(Listing 11.47). The result is a display of the feed on the Home page, as
required (Figure 11.14). -->
